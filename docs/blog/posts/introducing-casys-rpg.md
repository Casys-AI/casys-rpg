## Why CASYS RPG?

Interactive game books have been around for decades, but they've always been limited by their static nature. CASYS RPG changes this by introducing dynamic storytelling powered by five specialized AI agents:

- **StoryGraph**: Manages game flow and state transitions
- **RulesAgent**: Interprets and applies game rules
- **DecisionAgent**: Handles complex decision-making
- **NarratorAgent**: Crafts engaging narrative responses
- **TraceAgent**: Tracks character progress and game statistics

## Technical Innovation

Our architecture leverages cutting-edge technologies:

- LangChain and LangGraph for agent orchestration
- FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- Pydantic v2 for robust state management
- Modern frontend with SvelteKit and TailwindCSS

## What's Next?

We're actively working on:

1. Enhanced rule interpretation capabilities
2. Improved narrative generation
3. Advanced character progression systems
4. Extended documentation and tutorials

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and enhance CASYS RPG!
