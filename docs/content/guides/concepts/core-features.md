## Dynamic Storytelling

!!! tip "Adaptive Narrative System"
    === "Story Evolution"
        - **Dynamic Plot Adaptation** through StoryGraph
        - **Contextual Responses** based on player choices
        - **Persistent World State** tracking
        
        ```mermaid
        graph LR
            A[Player Choice] --> B[Context Analysis]
            B --> C[Story Adaptation]
            C --> D[World Update]
            D --> E[Narrative Response]
        ```

    === "AI Agents"
        Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of the game:

        - **StoryGraph**: Narrative flow orchestration
        - **NarratorAgent**: Content generation and presentation
        - **TraceAgent**: History and continuity management

## Intelligent Game Mechanics

!!! example "Advanced Rule Processing"
    === "Rules Engine"
        - **Real-time Rule Interpretation** using GPT-4o-mini
        - **Contextual Dice System** for dynamic difficulty
        - **Adaptive Challenge Scaling**

        ```python
        # Example Rule Processing
        async def process_rule(context: GameContext) -> RuleResult:
            # Dynamic rule interpretation based on context
            interpretation = await rules_agent.interpret(context)
            # Contextual difficulty adjustment
            difficulty = calculate_difficulty(context, interpretation)
            return apply_rules(interpretation, difficulty)
        ```

    === "Decision System"
        - **Complex Choice Resolution**
        - **Consequence Tracking**
        - **Strategic Depth Analysis**
