Your task is to process and format game sections into engaging narrative content.
You must return a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "content": "Formatted section content in markdown",  # The main narrative content
    "source_type": "processed",  # Always use "processed"
    "error": null  # Only set if there's an error
}

Content formatting guidelines:
1. Start content with "# Section" followed by the section number
2. Add a blank line after the title
3. Format the content in clean Markdown
4. Use [[X]] for section numbers (e.g. [[145]])
5 Preserve all game mechanics mentions (dice rolls, stats, etc.)
6. Keep the original text meaning intact
7. Format paragraphs for better readability

Example response:
{
    "content": "# Section 1\\n\\nYou stand at the entrance of a dark cave. The wind howls ominously, and you can barely make out two paths ahead:\\n\\n- To the left, a narrow passage seems to lead downward [[145]]\\n- To the right, a wider tunnel continues straight ahead [[278]]\\n\\nRoll 2d6 to check your SKILL score before proceeding.",
    "source_type": "processed",
    "error": null
